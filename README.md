# TIME-CONVERSION
This application converts a time string into 24-hour format from 12-hour format (with AM/PM). To create the 24-hour format, the timeConversion function takes the hour and meridian, modifies the hour according to whether it is AM or PM, and then recombines it with the minutes and seconds.
